The Treaty of Waitangi is a significant document in New Zealand's history, signed in 1840 between representatives of the British Crown and various Māori chiefs. It aimed to establish a partnership between the two parties, recognizing Māori rights to their lands, resources, and culture while granting British sovereignty over New Zealand. However, interpretations and implementations of the treaty have been complex and contested over time, leading to ongoing discussions and negotiations regarding its implications for modern New Zealand society.
