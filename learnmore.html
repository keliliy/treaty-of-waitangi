            <p>The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between representatives of the British Crown and various Māori chiefs in New Zealand, is a foundational document in the nation's history. It aimed to establish a framework for British governance while protecting Māori rights and land ownership. However, its interpretation and implementation have been controversial, with ongoing debates over issues like sovereignty, land ownership, and the protection of Māori culture and language. The treaty remains a central element in New Zealand's constitutional framework and continues to influence legal and political discussions regarding indigenous rights and reconciliation.</p>
